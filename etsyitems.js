Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",

         "description":"Rare Royal Doulton McCallums Scot Whiskey Ash Tray \u2013 1940\u2019s\r\nCheck out this very rare Royal Dalton McCallums Scot Whiskey Ashtray. This piece was made in England by Royal Doulton. I don\u2019t know the year but I would imagine around the 1940\u2019s. As you can see from the photos the Regular Trade Mark logo is printed on both sides of the ashtray. It is ivory ceramic with black graphics that are very, very, good. It measures 5\u201d long x 2\u201d high and 2\u201d deep. It is in remarkable condition considering its age. There are no scratches, chips, staining or fading anywhere on this piece.\r\n\r\nThe Doulton factory was founded in the 1815 to produce drainage and sanitary wares as well as some domestic wares and was producing decorative stonewares by the second half of the 19th century. This is a typical example from the early part of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nWe can combine shipping.  Simply email us the items you\u2019re interested in and zip code and we\u2019ll respond ASAP.  Please email us for Canada, Hawaii, Alaska and international rates.\r\n\r\nThank you for shopping at Blissful Beatrice!",

I  love advertising from the WWI era and the 1920&#39;s but I also sell postcards, programs or many other &quot;paper&quot; items in my shop.  Also in my shop are pillows that I have designed along with some of my photography.\r\n\r\nA Word about Vintage Advertising:\r\n\r\nThe advertisements I sell are ALWAYS the actual, original ad from a vintage magazine. \r\n\r\nVintage ads look great matted and framed.  You can hang them in a theme room (media room, anyone?).  They are truly wonderful works of art by some of the best illustrators that ever lived! \r\n\r\nThey are also just plain FUN to collect!\r\n\r\nYou can use them for scrapbooking or art projects (although personally I would never ruin them like that but\u2026to each their own!).\r\n\r\nThere is no rhyme or reason to what I list\u2026I find them ALL fascinating so I try to sell as many different types of ads as I can!\r\n\r\nHave fun, collect paper ephemera!!\r\n\r\nNow back to the rest of it:\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for anything specific (a certain store ad, a certain book, work by a specific illustrator) please email me.  I have 1,000&#39;s of ads that may eventually make it on to this site but I am always happy to take a look and see if I have what you need.  I hope, since you are stopping in, that you love old things as much as I do.  A framed vintage ad is a great decorative item to add to your home!!\r\n\r\nSo grab some coffee, sit back and visit a bygone era!",

         "description":"Doc is rich pipe tobacco & good slosh of bourbon whiskey thrown in for good measure.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for one (1) 1-dram amber glass bottle of fragrance oil. This oil has been mixed into a base of pure grapeseed oil....this means you do not have to dilute and it is safe to put it directly on your skin. It is still a very strong oil and a little goes a long way :) \r\n*********************************************************************************************************\r\nThe Outlaw line:\r\n\r\n*Jesse (No. 1) - a rich, leathery fragrance with notes of woods, musk, amber, tobacco plant, hay and aged saddle leather.\r\n\r\n*Dalton (No. 2) - woodsy and creamy. Cedarwood gives it an earthy tone, while the added vanilla bean gives it a hint of sweetness to keep it warm. Dalton has a nice outdoorsy, smokey, campfire feel to it.\r\n\r\n*Ringo (No. 3) - Classically clean, Ringo has a rich base of woods, musk and amber. This oil is infused with natural essential oils of sage, lavandin and orange.\r\nSmells a lot like a clean men&#39;s cologne.\r\n\r\n*Wyatt (No. 4) -the rich scent of pipe tobacco, woods and just a light hint of dark roasted coffee beans. \r\n\r\n*Josey (No 5) -is a cup of black coffee in the morning. You can&#39;t be a cowboy without this decoction :)\r\n\r\n*Doc -(No 6) rich pipe tobacco with a good slosh of bourbon whiskey!\r\n\r\n********************************************************************************************************\r\nHere are just a few ways you can use Outlaw oils!!\r\n\r\n- on your skin as a cologne\r\n- add a few drops to an oil burner (add water)\r\n- put in water for an air freshener spray\r\n- a few drops on your pillow\r\n- a drop on your cold light bulb to scent a room\r\n- keep a cotton ball with fragrance oil under your car seat\r\n- add to plain lotion\r\n- put in oil for massage\r\n- in your wood stove water pan\r\n- on your heat vents\r\n- on a love note\r\n- add to a burning candle\r\n- under the collar of a jacket\r\n- in a gym bag\r\n- in water on stove top",

Certainly never been played, possibly even still sealed.\r\n\r\n**Near Mint (NM or M-)\r\nA nearly perfect record. The record should show no obvious signs of wear. A 45 RPM or EP sleeve should have no more than the most minor defects, such as almost invisible ring wear or other signs of slight handling. An LP cover should have no creases, cut-out holes, folds, seam splits or other noticeable similar defects. The same should be true of any other inserts, such as posters, lyric sleeves and the like.\r\nBasically, an LP in near mint condition looks as if you just got it home from a new record store and removed the shrink wrap.\r\n\r\n**Very Good Plus (VG+)\r\nA Very Good Plus record will show some signs that it was played and otherwise handled by a previous owner who took good care of it. Record surfaces may show some signs of wear and may have slight scuffs or very light scratches that don&#39;t affect one&#39;s listening experiences. Slight warps that do not affect the sound are &quot;OK&quot;.\r\nThe label may have some ring wear or discoloration, but it should be barely noticeable. The center hole will not have been misshapen by repeated play. Picture sleeves and LP inner sleeves will have some slight wear, lightly turned up corners, or a slight seam split. An LP cover may have slight signs of wear and may be marred by a cut-out hole, indentation or corner indicating it was taken out of print and sold at a discount.\r\nIn general, if not for a couple things wrong with it, this would be Near Mint. Most collectors find a Very Good Plus record highly acceptable.\r\n\r\n**Very Good (VG)\r\nMany of the defects found in a VG+ record will be more pronounced in a VG record. Surface noise will be evident upon playing, especially in soft passages and during a song&#39;s intro and fade, but will not overpower the music otherwise. Groove wear will start to be noticeable, as with light scratches (deep enough to feel with a fingernail) that will affect the sound.\r\nLabels may be marred by writing, or have tape or stickers (or their residue) attached. The same will be true of picture sleeves or LP covers. However, it will not have all of these problems at the same time, only two or three of them.\r\n\r\n**Good (G), Good Plus (G+)\r\nGood does not mean Bad! A record in Good or Good Plus condition can be put onto a turntable and will play through without skipping. But it will have significant surface noise and scratches and visible groove wear.\r\nA cover or sleeve will have seam splits, especially at the bottom or on the spine. Tape, writing, ring wear or other defects will start to overwhelm the object.\r\n\r\n**Poor (P), Fair (F)\r\n\r\nThe record is cracked, badly warped, and won&#39;t play through without skipping or repeating. The picture sleeve is water damaged, split on all three seams and heavily marred by wear and writing. The LP cover barely keeps the LP inside it. Inner sleeves are fully seam split, crinkled, and written upon.\r\nExcept for impossibly rare records otherwise unattainable, records in this condition will not be found in my shop.\r\n\r\nOther Considerations\r\n\r\nA separate grade is assigned to the record and it&#39;s sleeve or cover. In each listing, a record&#39;s grade is listed first, followed by that of the sleeve or the cover.",
